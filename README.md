This is a PHP Client interface to a Lagoon GraphQL instance.  It's entirely auto-generated.

# Using this project

## Installation

The plan is that you'll be able to do composer install

## Code

See:

-	[php-graphql-oqm](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-oqm)
-	[php-graphql-client](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-client)

# Contributions

Everything inside lib/php is autogenerated.  Any PR that changes anything in 
there will be overwritten in future, so don't do it.  To make changes to that,
update [php-graphql-oqm](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-oqm).  

Everything else can be updated as per the usual (ie. submit a PR).  

## Updating the Code in lib/php

To update the code in this repo, the process is:

-	Be someone with at least Org Admin privileges
-	Check out a branch of the project on a machine where you have the 
	Lagoon CLI already set up and working
-	From the project directory, run `./project regenerate`.  Note: This 
	will read your $HOME/.lagoon.yml to read the graphql interface
-	Use git to commit/push the changes
-	Use github to create a PR
